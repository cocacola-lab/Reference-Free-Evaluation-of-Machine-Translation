We use partial of the public released code BERTScore. (https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert_score)
In order to use its framework for training, we modify "score.py" and "utils.py", which now locates in "bert_score_for_training" folder.

First, run aug_data.py to generate augmented data.
Then, run sh_main.sh to do sentence-level training.

Requirements:
python == 3.7.10
pytorch == 1.6.0
transformer == 4.11.3
numpy == 1.21.0
tqdm == 4.62.3
